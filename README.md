# DisasterSense 
Advanced Neural Network for Predicting Natural Catastrophes and Impacts

**DisasterSense** is an advanced C++ project designed to analyze natural disaster risks and predict their potential impacts using artificial neural networks (ANNs) such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The project integrates libraries like Eigen for matrix operations, JSON for data manipulation, and SFML for graphical visualizations.
